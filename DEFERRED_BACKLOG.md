# Deferred backlog

Items intentionally deferred from completed areas, to be covered in their
owning area later. Each notes WHERE the data already lands so the later work is
display/seed wiring, not a rebuild.

## From Area 1 — Extraction
- **Relationships tab live rendering** — accepted relationship candidates now
  persist with `fromId`/`toId`/`type` in `data`, but the Relationships tab
  (`relationships.jsx`) still renders demo data. → **Area 4 (visual tabs)**.
- **Skill-tree assignment selector on skill candidates** — discovered skills
  land as entities; assigning them to a tree needs the skill-tree system. →
  **Skill Trees (Area 4/7)**.
- **Travel/location display** — `cast.data.location` is set on accept; showing
  it in the Cast dossier + an Atlas travel line. → **Area 3 (Cast) / Atlas**.
- **Source-quote provenance shown in dossiers** (the occurrence carries it). →
  **Area 3 (Cast dossier)**.
- **Two-pass relationship extraction** (richer relationship records). → later
  extraction-quality pass.

## From Area 2 — Onboarding
- **Genre RPG entity templates** — seed example classes/races/abilities from the
  chosen genre/template. The template + toggles + custom stats are captured and
  persisted (custom stats already seed real Stats entities). → **RPG depth**.
- **"Import existing project"** — the Welcome "import" start option has no
  file-import flow in onboarding; wire it to `ProjectArchiveService.applyImport`.
  → onboarding follow-up / Project I/O.
- **Apply workspace.* layout prefs** — editorWidth/font/margins/panelStack etc.
  are now persisted to the `workspace` settings section, but the Writer's Room
  doesn't yet read them (startTab IS used for routing). → **Writers Room polish**.
- **Deeper AI style critique** of the voice sample beyond the local metrics
  (which are implemented). → **AI Writer area**.

## Cross-cutting (not yet scheduled)
- **Multi-project support** (single project per device today).
- **AI Writer model picker UI** (routing already supports per-task models).
- **Offline grammar/spell/thesaurus** in the Writer's Room (Word-like). →
  **Writers Room polish**.
